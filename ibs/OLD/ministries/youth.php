      <h1>  Youth Ministry</h1>
      <p>Shalom's Youth ministry provides opportunities of growth for teens and young adults a like. Serving middle school to college students, we believe and emphasize in creating youth with the ability to understand, share, and live a life of faith in Christ.</p>
      <p>We offer weekly Bible studies "Brain Food" where we study scripture and its present day application for a young culture dealing with the social pressures of today. We also host youth "Social Night" where we  have a variety of activities from bowling, laser tag, to ice-skating with the intention of developing effective fellowship and camaraderie.</p>
      <p>Come join us and experience the love and fellowship of other young believers in the body of Christ!</p>
